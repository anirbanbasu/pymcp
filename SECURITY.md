# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The PyMCP project and its maintainers take security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### What Constitutes a Vulnerability?

A security vulnerability is a weakness in the software that compromises data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. This may happen by enabling:

- Remote code execution.
- Elevated permissions or privilege escalation.
- Unintended access to data or systems.
- Denial of service attacks.
- Bypass of security controls.

**Note:** Intentional design decisions, feature requests, or suggestions for security improvements that do not involve an actual exploitable flaw are not considered vulnerabilities. If you have suggestions for security enhancements, please open a feature request instead.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by:

1. **Opening a security issue** on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/anirbanbasu/PyMCP/issues/new)
   - Please use the title prefix: `[SECURITY]`
   - Mark the issue as sensitive if GitHub offers that option
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability (see below)

### Information to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and address the issue quickly, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions of PyMCP
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any proof-of-concept code (if available)
- Suggestions for fixing the issue (if you have any)

You can use our security issue reporting template.

## Recognition

We believe in recognizing the valuable contributions of security researchers. If you report a valid vulnerability:

- We will credit you in our security advisory and release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
- Your contribution will be acknowledged in our project documentation.
- We will work collaboratively with you throughout the disclosure process.

## Out of Scope

The following are generally **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- Issues in dependencies (please report these to the respective upstream projects).
- Vulnerabilities in outdated or unsupported versions.
- Social engineering attacks.
- Denial of service via resource exhaustion without amplification.
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's device.

## Security Best Practices for Users

While using PyMCP, we recommend:

- Always use the latest stable version.
- Keep all dependencies up to date.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when running MCP servers.
- Review and understand the tools and resources exposed by the server.
- Monitor security advisories in our GitHub Security tab.

## Questions?

If you have questions about our security policy or the vulnerability disclosure process, please open a discussion on our GitHub repository.

## Updates to This Policy

This security policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will always be available in this repository.
